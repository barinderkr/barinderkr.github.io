In this post I explained some of the major jargons and definitions that are needed to understand the basic theory of data science which will be discussed in later posts in depth.

### What is Data Science?

  - Data Science is a field in which we use **Data** to answer **Questions**!
  - It involves:
    - Statistics
    - Computer Science
    - Mathematics
    - Data Cleaning & Formating
    - Data Visualisation

### Types of Data Sceince Questions 
In the approximate order of difficulty

  - **Descriptive**
  	
    - The goal of descriptive analysis is to describe or summarize a set of data.
    - Descriptive analysis will generate simple summaries about the samples and their measurements. For Ex: measures of central tendency (eg: mean, median, mode) or
       measures of variability (eg: range, standard deviations or variance).
    - Censuses is a common example of descriptive analysis
 
 
  - **Exploratory**
    - The goal of exploratory analysis is to examine or explore the data and find relationships. that weren’t previously known
    - Just because you observe a relationship between two variables during exploratory analysis, it does not mean that one necessarily causes the other.
  
  
  - **Inferential**
    - The goal of inferential analyses is to use a relatively small sample of data to infer or say something about the population at large. 
    - Inferential analysis is commonly the goal of statistical modelling, where you have a small amount of information to extrapolate and generalize that information to a larger group.
   
  - **Predictive**
    - The goal of predictive analysis is to use current data to make predictions about future data. 
  
  - **Causal**
    -  the goal of causal analysis is to see what happens to one variable when we manipulate another variable - looking at the cause and effect of a relationship.
  - **Mechanistic**
    - The goal of mechanistic analysis is to understand the exact changes in variables that lead to exact changes in other variables. 
    
    
### What does experimental design mean?
 
Experimental design is organizing an experiment so that you have the correct data
  This process involves:
  - Clearly formulating your question in advance of any data collection
  - Designing the best set-up possible to gather the data to answer your question
  - Identifying problems or sources of error in your design
  - Collecting the appropriate data.

Principles of experimental design
  - **Independent variable** (AKA factor): The variable that the experimenter manipulates; it does not depend on other variables being measured. Often displayed on the x-axis.
  - **Dependent variable**: The variable that is expected to change as a result of changes in the independent variable. Often displayed on the y-axis, so that changes in X, the independent variable, effect changes in Y.
  - **Confounder**: An extraneous variable that may affect the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. This “balancing” of confounders is often achieved by randomization.
  - **Replication**: It is pretty much what it sounds like, repeating an experiment with different experimental subjects
  - **P-Value**: One of the many things often reported in experiments is a value called the p-value. This is a value that tells you the probability that the results of your experiment were observed by chance. 
  
  
  
  R and Python language is an essential learning in Data Science. In the next post I familarize you with R and its usages.
