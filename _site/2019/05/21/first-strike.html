    <p>In this post I explained some of the major jargons and definitions that are needed to understand the basic theory of data science which will be discussed in later posts in depth.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-data-science">What is Data Science?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Data Science is a field in which we use <strong>Data</strong> to answer <strong>Questions</strong>!</li>
  <li>It involves:
    <ul>
      <li>Statistics</li>
      <li>Computer Science</li>
      <li>Mathematics</li>
      <li>Data Cleaning &amp; Formating</li>
      <li>Data Visualisation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="types-of-data-sceince-questions">Types of Data Sceince Questions</h3>
<p>In the approximate order of difficulty</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Descriptive</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>The goal of descriptive analysis is to describe or summarize a set of data.</li>
      <li>Descriptive analysis will generate simple summaries about the samples and their measurements. For Ex: measures of central tendency (eg: mean, median, mode) or
 measures of variability (eg: range, standard deviations or variance).</li>
      <li>Censuses is a common example of descriptive analysis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Exploratory</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The goal of exploratory analysis is to examine or explore the data and find relationships. that weren’t previously known</li>
      <li>Just because you observe a relationship between two variables during exploratory analysis, it does not mean that one necessarily causes the other.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Inferential</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The goal of inferential analyses is to use a relatively small sample of data to infer or say something about the population at large.</li>
      <li>Inferential analysis is commonly the goal of statistical modelling, where you have a small amount of information to extrapolate and generalize that information to a larger group.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Predictive</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The goal of predictive analysis is to use current data to make predictions about future data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Causal</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>the goal of causal analysis is to see what happens to one variable when we manipulate another variable - looking at the cause and effect of a relationship.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mechanistic</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The goal of mechanistic analysis is to understand the exact changes in variables that lead to exact changes in other variables.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-does-experimental-design-mean">What does experimental design mean?</h3>

<p>Experimental design is organizing an experiment so that you have the correct data
  This process involves:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clearly formulating your question in advance of any data collection</li>
  <li>Designing the best set-up possible to gather the data to answer your question</li>
  <li>Identifying problems or sources of error in your design</li>
  <li>Collecting the appropriate data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Principles of experimental design</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Independent variable</strong> (AKA factor): The variable that the experimenter manipulates; it does not depend on other variables being measured. Often displayed on the x-axis.</li>
  <li><strong>Dependent variable</strong>: The variable that is expected to change as a result of changes in the independent variable. Often displayed on the y-axis, so that changes in X, the independent variable, effect changes in Y.</li>
  <li><strong>Confounder</strong>: An extraneous variable that may affect the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. This “balancing” of confounders is often achieved by randomization.</li>
  <li><strong>Replication</strong>: It is pretty much what it sounds like, repeating an experiment with different experimental subjects</li>
  <li><strong>P-Value</strong>: One of the many things often reported in experiments is a value called the p-value. This is a value that tells you the probability that the results of your experiment were observed by chance.</li>
</ul>

<p>R and Python language is an essential learning in Data Science. In the next post I familarize you with R and its usages.</p>
