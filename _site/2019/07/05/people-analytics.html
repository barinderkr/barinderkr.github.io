  <p>Hi folks, I come up with another blog and this time we’re gonna take a deep dive and practices about people analytics, so let’s begin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>People analytics</strong> is a data-controlled approach of managing workforce related decisions.</p>

<p>People analytics which is also known as HR- analytics, workforce-analytics, or talent-analytics revolves around analysing people-related issues, such as <em>recruiting, performance evaluation, leadership, hiring and promotion, job design, compensation, and collaboration using data</em>. Advanced analytics can optimise the way, organisations identify, attract, develop, and retain talent. It can help managers make better decisions about employees or workforce.</p>

<p>The best-known scientific definition of HR analytics is by <em>Heuvel &amp; Bondarouk</em>. According to them, ”HR analytics is the systematic identification and quantification of the people drivers of business outcomes” (Heuvel &amp; Bondarouk, 2016).</p>

<p>People analytics aims at replacing intuition and human instincts-based decisions with data driven decision making. People analytics applies statistics, technology and expertise to large sets of talent data, which results in making better management and business decisions for an organisation.</p>

</ul>

<p>HR departments have a vast amounts of HR data which often remains unused until organisations start to analyse their people problems by using this data. When they do so, they are actually occupied in HR analytics.</p>

<h3 id="driving-factors-of-workforce-analytics">Driving factors of workforce analytics:</h3>

<p>There are a variety of internal and external factors that influence the organisations to use People analytics to streamline their Workforce related processes.</p>

<p><strong>External Factors</strong>: The transforming Global Market is the major driving factor for digging deep into the effective utilization of resources and capabilities across organisation. In addition to that, the encouragement of more transparent norms, necessitates the organisations to follow more streamlined and unbiased processes in hiring and promotions. The availability of huge amount of data like - external labour market data and social network applications can facilitate in applying semantic analytics to uncover people emotions, which can give excellent insights.</p>

<p><strong>Internal Factors</strong>: Workforce analytics of the company being acquired - can influence highly strategic decisions like mergers and acquisitions of companies. This can give an insightful view of the workforce, with which we can take better decisions of reforming leadership and capabilities requirements. A deep analysis of the existing workforce can be used to classify the employees as Top Performers. The companies can continuously address employee engagement which can increase the retention rate of the Top Performers and reduce the hiring effort. A thorough company wide analytics can be implemented to build norms for data compliance.</p>

<h3 id="real-life-examples-of-people-analytics-">Real Life Examples of People Analytics-</h3>

<p><strong>Recruiting decisions in a bank:</strong></p>

<p>An Asian bank with 8,000 people across 30 branches decided to leverage data analytics to reform hiring process, identify top performers, reassigning roles, and gain insight of key indicators of performance.</p>

<p>Data about 30 factors aligned with 5 categories - demographics, branch information, performance, professional history, and tenure – was gathered for each employee. Analytics was then used to identify characteristics of high and low performers and classify them in profiles accordingly.</p>

<p>Further ML - based analysis disclosed that financial outcomes were highly dependent on branch and team structures. It also revealed that bank’s overall success was influenced by a few key roles. As a result, new organizational structures were proposed and previous assumptions about internal hiring were upgraded.</p>

<p>Deeper analysis proved that most efficient people came from a variety of institutions and not just Top academic institutions. Further it was observed that certain positions served as catalysts for Top Performers.</p>

<p>Both these findings have changed the processes around: bank recruitment, performance measurement, and matching profiles to roles. The results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>26 percent increase in branch productivity</li>
  <li>80 percent increase in rate of conversion of new recruits after changes were put in place</li>
  <li>Net income also increased by 14 percent.</li>
</ul>
